-- Next steps --
1. REBOOT THE SERVER! Some changes need a reboot to be applied.
2. Retrieve your passwords from passwords.txt, store them somewhere safe and shred the file. 
3. Launch DomJudge with N judgehosts with './start.sh N'. Note that N can be arbitrarily large, but any judgehost that cannot be assigned to a CPU core will die, so make sure you have enough cores.
Judgehosts should register automatically and appear in the corresponding section inside the DomJudge interface
4. Stop the services at any time executing ./stop.sh.

-- Any problem? --
1. Try to google the problem first.
2. Open an issue in https://github.com/rmartinsanta/domjudge-automation/
When reporting issues, please attach the output of 'docker ps' and './viewlogs.sh'.
